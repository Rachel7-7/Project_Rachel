Rhythm Practice Tool
Rachel

1.Project Description (2-3 sentences): Clearly state what your software will do and who would use it.

My software generates various rhythm patterns based on users' needs. Users can practice using built-in or customized rhythms by tapping the space-bar on their laptop. The software analyzes the timing accuracy, whether the taps are early or late, and provides feedback after each session, saving practice data so users can review their progress over time.


2.Core Features (3-5 bullet points): List the main functionality your software will have. Be specific but realistic.
- Built-in rhythm patterns (e.g. 4/4, 3/4) and option for custom rhythm input
- Pressing the space-bar to match the rhythm
- records press timing and compares it with the target rhythm?
- Provides feedback on accuracy (early/late)

3.Visual Design (Required: 1 wireframe or mockup): Include a simple wireframe, sketch, or mockup showing what your user interface will look like. Hand-drawn sketches are perfectly acceptable.


4.Technical Overview: Create either a diagram that shows how different functions/classes will interact or provide pseudocode that illustrates the program flow.

  while user doesn't quit:
    Get user choice (select pattern, practice, view history)

    if select pattern:
        Show built-in and custom rhythm options
        Save user selection
    elif practice:
        Play selected rhythm
        Record user key-press timing
        Compare user input to correct timing
        Give feedback (on-time, early, late)
        Save practice result to file
    elif view history:
        Load and display previous practice data
